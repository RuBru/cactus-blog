    <p>Random walk down the Wall Street is a personal finance classic. This is a fundamental book as it has been written ~40 years ago and still is relevant.</p>
<p>The book consists of four big parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stocks and their value</strong>: a short intro in the history of financial markets and its bubbles.</li>
<li><strong>How the pros play the biggest game in town</strong>: how good or bad the various analysis used to pick stocks work (&#x3D; bad!).</li>
<li><strong>The new investment technology</strong>: more elaborate investment techniques created in the last decades.</li>
<li><strong>A practical guide for random walkers and other investors</strong>: guides, techniques and specific advice to create personalised investment portfolio.</li>
</ol>
<p>I enjoyed the book most of the time, but sadly this, as most books about personal finance, is a book for US audience. That means that most advice about taxes and law is not apliccable to me as a European.</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>(The rule of 72)[#The-rule-of-72]</li>
<li>“Strategies that become well known often lose their effectiveness after publication of their results.”</li>
<li>It is critical that you understand yourself.</li>
<li>There is no sure and easy road to riches. High returns can be achieved only through higher risk-taking (and perhaps through accepting lower liquidity)</li>
<li>You get what you don’t pay for (talking about commissions)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Timelss lessons involve vroad diversification, annual rebalancing, using index funds, and staying the course.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="Stocks-and-their-value"><a href="#Stocks-and-their-value" class="headerlink" title="Stocks and their value"></a>Stocks and their value</h2><p>What is value and how you determine it? That’s the question we learn about in this section and go through main stock pricing theories and the history of stock market’s heights and lows.</p>
<h3 id="Firm-foundation-theory"><a href="#Firm-foundation-theory" class="headerlink" title="Firm foundation theory"></a>Firm foundation theory</h3><p>The firm foundation theory argues that each investment instrument, be it a common stock or a piece of real estate, has a firm anchor of something called intrinsic value, which can be determined by careful analysis of present conditions and future prospects.</p>
<p>Firm-foundation theory relies on some tricky forecasts of the extent and duration of future growth. The foundation of intrinsic value may thus be less dependable than is claimed.</p>
<h3 id="Castle-in-the-air-theory"><a href="#Castle-in-the-air-theory" class="headerlink" title="Castle-in-the-air theory"></a>Castle-in-the-air theory</h3><p>The castle-in-the-air theory of investing concentrates on psychic values. It was a famous investors opinion that professional investors prefer to devot their energies not to estimating intrinsic values, but rather to analyzing how the crowd of investors is likely to behave in the future and how during periods of optimism they tend to build their hopes into castles in the air. The successful investor tries to beat the gun by estimating what investment situations are most susceptible to public castle-building and then buying before the crowd.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no one knows for sure what will influence future earnings’ prospects and dividend payments. … Most people are largely concerned not with making superior long-term forecasts for an investment over its whole life, but with foreseeing changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the general public.<br>&#x2F; John Maynard Keynes, got popular in 1936</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in.The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.<br>&#x2F; Mark Twain, Pudd’nhead Wilson</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Madness-of-crowds"><a href="#Madness-of-crowds" class="headerlink" title="Madness of crowds"></a>Madness of crowds</h3><p>Since there has been a market, there have been speculative bubbles and crisis after those:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tulip bulb craze</li>
<li>The south sea bubble</li>
<li>Wall street lays an egg (1929)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past century since the sixties the craze has gone from private to institutional investing:</p>
<ul>
<li>60’s: The growth-stock&#x2F;new-issue craze (space age: if anything has a name ..tronics or something you don’t understand, you buy it)</li>
<li>60’s: The conglomerate boom (join two companies and suddenly they are growing)</li>
<li>60’s: The bubble in Concept stocks (buy “performance”)</li>
<li>70’s: The nifty fifty stocks (a bunch of big growth company stocks, just “one decision” to make)</li>
<li>80’s: The return of New Issues (microelectronics and biotechnology age: if anything has a name ..bot, you buy it)</li>
<li>90’s:Japanese yen for land and stocks (because Japan’s land and stocks in 100x more worthy than 40 years ago)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The consistent losers in the market, from my perosnal experience, are those who are unable to resist being swept up in some kind of tuli-bulb craze. It is not hard to make money in the market. What is hard to avoid is the alluring temptation to throw your money away on short, get-rich-quick speculative binges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course, this millenia is even better than the previous:</p>
<ul>
<li>2000: dot-com bubble</li>
<li>2008: housing bubble</li>
<li>2017: crypto bubble</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Bubbles are “positive feedback loops”. A bubble starts when any groups of stocks, in this case those associated with the excitement of the internet, begin to rise. The updraft encourages more people to buy the stocks, which causes more TV and print coverage, which causes even more people to buy, which creates big profits for early internet stockholders. The successful investors tell you how easy it is to get rich, which causes the stocks to rise further, whic pulls in larger and larger groups of investors. But the whole mechanism is a kind of Ponzi scheme where more and more credulous investors must be found to buy the stock from the earlier investors. Eventually, one runs out of <strong>greater fools</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The market eventually corrects any irrationality - albeit in its own slow, inexorable fashion. Anomalies can crop up, markets can get irrationally optimistic, and often they attract unwary investors. But, <strong>eventually, true value is recognized by the market</strong>, and this is the main lesson investors must heed.</p>
<p>I am also persuaded by the wisdom of Benjamin Graham, author of Security Analysis, who wrote that in the final analysis the stock market is not a voting mechanism but a weighing mechanism. Valuation metrics have not changed. Eventually, every stock can only be worth the present value of its cash flow. In the final analysis true value will win out.</p>

<h2 id="How-the-pros-play-the-biggest-game-in-town"><a href="#How-the-pros-play-the-biggest-game-in-town" class="headerlink" title="How the pros play the biggest game in town"></a>How the pros play the biggest game in town</h2><blockquote>
<p>As more and more people use the technique, the value deteriorates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The alternative techniques used by the investment pros are related to the two theories of the stick market:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical analysis</strong> is the method of predicting the approriate time to buy or sell a stock used by those believing in the <strong>castle-in-the-air</strong> view of stock pricing.</li>

Take the interest rate you earn and divide it into the number 72, and you get the number of years it will take to double your money.</p>
<p>For example, if the interest rate is 15 percent, it takes 72&#x2F;15&#x3D;4.8 years to double.</p>

Thus, to get a higher average long-run rate of return, you need to increase the risk level of the portfolio that cannot be diversified away. According to this theory, savvy investors can outperform the overall market by adjusting their portfolios with a risk measure known as <strong>beta</strong> (systematic or market risk).</p>

<p>Behavioralists believe that market prices are highly imprecise. Moreover, people deviate in systematic ways from rationality, and the irrational trades of investors tend to be correlated. Behavioral finance then takes that statement further by asserting that it is posiible to quantify or classify such irrational behavior. Basically, there are four factors that create irrational market behavior: <strong>overconfidence, biased judgments, herd mentality, and loss aversion</strong>.</p>

If you do want to take a chance that some risk factors will generate improved risk-adjusted returns in the future, you can do so most prudently if the core of your portfolio consists of capitalisation-weighted broad-based index funds. And if you do want to add additional risk factors in the pursuit of extra return, I recommend a low-expense multifactor offering rather than a fund concentrating on one risk factor.</p>
<h3 id="Risk-parity"><a href="#Risk-parity" class="headerlink" title="Risk parity"></a>Risk parity</h3><p>Risk parity are investment techniques. <strong>They are based on a evidence-based principle that relatively safe assets often provide higher returns than are appropriate for their level of risk, while riskier assets are relatively overpriced and return less than they should.</strong> Investors can therefore improve their results by leveraging low-risk assets, buying them with some borrowed money, so as to increase their risk and return (buy in margin).</p>

<li>Dollar-cost averaging can be a useful, though controversial, technique to reduce the risk of stock and bond investment.</li>
<li>Rebalancing can reduce risk and, in some circumstances, increase investment returns.</li>

She has been forced to give up her job as a registered nurse because of increasingly severe arthritis. Her modest house in Homewood, Illinois, is still mortgaged. Although the mortgage was taken out at a relatively low rate, it involves substantial monthly payments. Apart from monthly Social Security checks, all Mildred has to live on are the earnings on a $250,000 insurance policy of which she is the beneficiary and a $50,000 portfolio of small-growth stocks accumulated by her late husband.</p>
<p>It is clear that Mildred’s capacity to bear risk is severely constrained by her financial situation. She has neither the life expectancy nor the physical ability to earn income outside her portfolio. Moreover, she has substantial fixed expenditures on her mortgage. She would have no ability to recoup a loss on her portfolio. She needs a portfolio of safe investments that can generate substantial income. Bonds and high-dividend-paying stocks, as from an index fund of real estate investment trusts, are the kinds of investments that are suitable. Risky (often non-dividend-paying) stocks of small-growth companies—no matter how attractive their prices may be—do not belong in Mildred’s portfolio.</p>

She just inherited a $50,000 legacy from her grandmother’s estate. Her goal is to build a sizable portfolio that in later years could finance the purchase of a home and be available as a retirement nest egg.</p>
<p>For Tiffany, one can safely recommend an aggressive portfolio. She has both the life expectancy and the earning power to maintain her standard of living in the face of any financial loss. Although her personality will determine the precise amount of risk exposure she is willing to undertake, it is clear that Tiffany’s portfolio belongs toward the far end of the risk-reward spectrum. Mildred’s portfolio of small-growth stocks would be far more appropriate for Tiffany than for a sixty-four-year-old widow who is unable to work.</p>

His wife, Joan, had a $12,500 annual income from selling Avon products. The Ps had four children, ages six to fifteen. Carl and Joan wanted all the children to attend college. They realized that private colleges were probably beyond their means but hoped that an education within the excellent Michigan state university system would be feasible. Fortunately, Carl had been saving regularly through the GM payroll savings plan but had chosen the option of purchasing GM stock under the plan. He had accumulated GM stock worth $219,000. He had no other assets but did have substantial equity in a modest house with only a small mortgage remaining to be paid off.</p>
<p>I suggested that Carl and Joan had a highly problematic portfolio. Both their income and their investments were tied up in GM. A negative development that caused a sharp loss in GM’s common stock could ruin both the value of the portfolio and Carl’s livelihood. Indeed, the story ended badly. General Motors declared bankruptcy in 2009. Carl lost his job as well as his investment portfolio. And this is not an isolated example. Remember the sad lesson learned by many Enron employees who lost not only their jobs but all their savings in Enron stock when the company went under. Never take on the same risks in your portfolio that attach to your major source of income.</p>

<p>Total stock market index funds (thatinclude more than S&amp;P500 companies) have consistently provided higher returns than average equity mutual-fund manager.</p>
<p>Index funds currently exist that mimic the performance of various international indexes such as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index of European, Australasian, and Far Eastern (EAFE) securities, and the MSCI emerging-markets index. In addition, there are index funds holding real estate investment trusts (REITs) as well as corporate and government bonds.</p>

<p>I suggest that a substantial part of every portfolio be invested in emerging markets.</p>

<h4 id="ETFs-and-taxes"><a href="#ETFs-and-taxes" class="headerlink" title="ETFs and taxes"></a>ETFs and taxes</h4><p>Utilizing a sample of 62 mutual funds with long-term records, Stanford University economists found that, pre-tax, $1 invested in 1962 would have grown to $21.89 in 1992. After paying taxes on income dividends and capital gains distributions, however, that same $1 invested in mutual funds by a high-income investor would have grown to only $9.87</p>
<p>To a considerable extent, index mutual funds help solve the tax problem. Because they do not trade from security to security, they tend to avoid capital gains taxes. Nevertheless, even index funds can realize some capital gains that are taxable to the holders. These gains generally arise involuntarily, either because of a buyout of one of the companies in the index, or because sales are forced on the mutual fund. The latter occurs when mutual-fund shareholders decide on balance to redeem their shares and the fund must sell securities to raise cash. Thus, even regular index funds are not a perfect solution for the problem of minimizing tax liabilities.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded index funds (ETFs) such as “spiders” (an S&amp;P 500 Fund) and “vipers” (a total stock market fund) can be more tax-efficient than regular index funds because they are able to make “in-kind” redemptions. In-kind redemptions proceed by delivering low-cost shares against redemption requests. This is not a taxable transaction for the fund, so there is no realization of gain that must be distributed. Moreover, the redeeming ETF shareholder pays taxes based on his or her original cost of the shares—not the fund’s basis in the basket of stocks that is delivered.</p>
<p>No-load index mutual funds will better serve investors who will be accumulating index shares over time in small amounts.</p>

<p>I sell before the end of each calendar year any stocks on which I have a loss. The reason for this timing is that losses are deductible (up to certain amounts) for tax purposes, or can offset gains you may already have taken. Thus, taking losses can lower your tax bill. I might hold a losing position if the growth I expect begins to materialize and I am convinced that my stock will eventually work out.</p>

<li>Confine stock purchases to companies that appear able to sustain above-average earnings <strong>growth</strong> for at least 5 years</li>
<li>Never pay more for a stock than can reasonably be justified by a firm foundation of value</li>
<li>It helps to buy stocks with the kinds of stories of anticipated growth on which investors can build castles in the air</li>
<li>Trade as little as possible</li>
