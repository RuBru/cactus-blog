    <h1 id="Review"><a href="#Review" class="headerlink" title="Review"></a>Review</h1><p>Rationality: from <strong>A</strong>I to <strong>Z</strong>ombies has a very correct name for this book (and it really talks about both AI and zombies and they are related!). Actually, this is not a book, but 6 books that are compiled together under one roof. These six book each talk about a different Bayesian rationality topic&#x2F;aspect in an ever increasing difficulty level and ending the series with a book of motivation and some more personal aspects of the author.</p>
<p>Before I etner the realm of books, a few notes about the autor.<br>Eliezer Yudkowsky is a Jew with a physicist fathers and physician mother (I think). This guy is super smart and works to make a friendly AI. The theoretical questions are also included in Rationality and give a very fresh perspective of what really are the problems in AI and how you should approach the field. He has become a rationalist because the people around him&#x2F;his parents in childhood could not really answer important questions and that made him quite early on, to become an atheist. The questioning and checking everything from first principles has led him there where he is.</p>
<p>This mega book consists of essays from a blog and has been formed into topic groups and further into books. Rationality has left me with a head full of information that would take more time to process than I did leave for processing while reading. The series started great - first book about biases was super fun, easy going and very informative, so kept going further in no time. The second and third bookd were not that easy anymore, but still doable. And I stuck on the fourth book - about science etc. This one was too much for me at a time, so I struggled and then stopped for a while. After some light literature, I returned and finished the series easily.</p>
<p>For me, the most interesting parts were about religion questions (because this would help in discussions with religious people) and about science and quantum physics (- nice explanation about quantum stuff from a different perspective than usual). After some books and especially this one, I and super sad I did not read more about scientific phylosophy before studies or at least at that time. Most probably I would be doing something else right now if I had the framework what actually science is.</p>
<p>This book has helped me start to set up a framework of what is right, what is wrong, how you should and should not think and reason. This is not just a book about a topic. It’s a workbook for everone who wants to lead a more fulfilling, rational and cause based life. It has changed my inner world and neurons so much (hopefully to the good side!) that I hope it will have a lasting effect.</p>
<p>BTW, some of the essays are short stories of a Bayesian rationality school&#x2F;temple that refresh the heavy load a bit. And at least once, one of these short stories totally saved my day (after a bit of mental break down and a big fight with Andrea in Brussels, at the cafeteria terrace). So, thank you Eliezer!</p>

<h1 id="Short-overview"><a href="#Short-overview" class="headerlink" title="Short overview"></a>Short overview</h1><p><a href="#Book-1-Map-and-Territory">Book 1: Map and Territory</a><br>What is a belief, and what makes some beliefs work better than others? These four sequences explain the Bayesian notions of rationality, belief, and evidence. A running theme: the things we call “explanations” or “theories” may not always function like maps for navigating the world. As a result, we risk mixing up our mental maps with the other objects in our toolbox.</p>
<p><a href="#Book-2-How-To-Actually-Change-Your-Mind">Book 2: How to Actually Change Your Mind</a><br>This truth thing seemspretty handy. Why, then, do we keep jumping to conclusions, digging our heels in, and recapitulating the same mistakes? Why are we so bad at acquiring accurate beliefs, and how can we do better? These seven sequences discuss motivated reasoning and confirmation bias, with a special focus on hard-to-spot species of self-deception and the trap of “using arguments as soldiers.”</p>
<p><a href="#Book-3-The-Machine-In-The-Ghost">Book 3: The Machine in the Ghost</a><br>Why haven’t we evolved to be more rational? Even taking into account resource constraints, it seems like we could be getting a lot more epistemic bang for our evidential buck. To get a realistic picture of how and why our minds execute their biological functions, we need to crack open the hood and see how evolution works, and how our brains work, with more precision. These three sequences illustrate how even philosophers and<br>scientists can be led astray when they rely on intuitive, non-technical evolutionary or psychological accounts. By locating our minds within a larger space of goal-directed systems, we can identify some of the peculiarities of human reasoning and appreciate how such systems can “lose their purpose.”</p>
<p><a href="#Book-4-Mere-Reality">Book 4: Mere Reality</a><br>What kind of world do we live in? What is our place in that world? Building on the previous sequences’ examples of how evolutionary and cognitive models work, these six sequences explore the nature of mind and the character of physical law. In addition to applying and generalizing past lessons on scientific mysteries and parsimony, these essays raise new questions about the role science should play in individual rationality.</p>
<p><a href="#Book-5-Mere-Goodness">Book 5: Mere Goodness</a><br>What makes something valuable—morally, or aesthetically, or prudentially? These three sequences ask how we can justify, revise, and naturalize our values and desires. The aim will be to find a way to understand our goals without compromising our efforts to actually achieve them. Here the biggest challenge is knowing when to trust your messy, complicated case-by-case impulses about what’s right and wrong, and when to replace them with simple exceptionless principles.</p>
<p><a href="#Book-6-Becoming-Stronger">Book 6: Becoming Stronger</a><br>How can individuals and communities put all this into practice? These three sequences begin with an autobiographical account of Yudkowsky’s own biggest philosophical blunders, with advice on how he thinks others might do better. The book closes with recommendations for developing evidence-based applied rationality curricula, and for forming groups and institutions to support interested students, educators, researchers, and<br>friends.</p>

Saying <em>God is uncaused</em> or <em>God created Himself</em> leaves us in exactly the same position as <em>Time began with the Big Bang.</em> We just ask why the whole metasystem exists in the first place, or why some events but not others are allowed to be uncaused.</p>

<h4 id="The-proper-use-of-humility"><a href="#The-proper-use-of-humility" class="headerlink" title="The proper use of humility"></a>The proper use of humility</h4><p>If you ask someone to <em>be more humble</em>, by default they’ll associate the words to social modesty - which is an intuitive, everyday, ancestrallly relevant concept.</p>
<p><em>Humility</em> is a virtue that is ofthen misunderstood. This doesn’t mean we should discard the concept of humility, but we should be careful using it. It may help to look at the actions recommended by a humble line of thinking, and ask: <strong>Does acting this way make you stronger or weaker?</strong></p>
<p>To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own errors. To confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not humble; it is boasting of your modesty.</p>
<p>BTW, you’d still double-check your calculations if you were wise.</p>
<h4 id="The-best-is-the-enemy-of-good"><a href="#The-best-is-the-enemy-of-good" class="headerlink" title="The best is the enemy of good"></a><em>The best</em> is the enemy of <em>good</em></h4><p><strong>Beware when you find yourself arguing that a policy is defensible rather than optimal</strong>;  or that it has some benefit compared to the null action, rather that the best benefit of any action.</p>

No one does pure good or pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefoe, no one is better that anyone else.</em><br>The Zetet: <em>Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view.</em></p>

Can’t we each choose for ourselves whether to care about the truth?</em></p>
<p>A snappy comeback: <em>Why do you care whether I care whether someone else carea bout the truth?</em></p>
<p>An actual answer: <em>I believe that it is right and proper for me, as a human being, to have an interest in the future, and what human civilization beomes in the future. One of those interests is the human pursuit if truth, which has strengthened slowly over the generations. I wich to strengthen that pursuit furtherm in this generation. That is a wish of mine, for the future. For we are all of us players upon that vast gameboard, whether we accept the responsibility or not.</em></p>
<h4 id="Correspondence-bias-feeling-normal"><a href="#Correspondence-bias-feeling-normal" class="headerlink" title="Correspondence bias - feeling normal"></a>Correspondence bias - feeling normal</h4><p><strong>We attribute our own actions to our situations, seeing our behaviours as perfectly normal responses to experience.</strong> But when someone else kicks a vending machine, we don’t see their past history trailing behind them in the air. We just see the kick, for no reason we know about, and we think this must be a naturally angry person - since they lashed out without any provocation.</p>
<p><strong>Most people see themselves as perfectly normal, from the inside</strong>. Even people you hate, people who do terrible things.</p>

<li>You try to define a word using words, in turn defined with even more abstract words, without being able to point to an example.</li>
<li>The extension doesn’t match the intension.</li>
<li>Your verbal definitions doesn’t capture more than a tiny fraction of the category’s shared characteristics, but you try to reason as if it does. (featherless byped “with broad nails”)</li>
<li>You try to treat category membership as all-or-nothing, ignoring the existence of more and less typical subclusters.</li>
<li>A verbal definition works well enough in practice to point out the intended cluster of similar things, but you nitpick exceptions. (humans with 9 fingers)</li>
<li>You ask whether something “is” or “is not” a category member but can’t name the question you really want answered. </li>
<li>You treat intuitively perceived hierarchical categories like the only correct  way to parse the world, without realizing that other forms of statistical inference are possible even though your brain doesn’t use them.</li>
<li>You talk about categories as if they are manna fallen from the Platonic Realm, rather than inferences implemented in a real brain.</li>
<li>You argue about a category membership (is it a blegg?) even after screening off all questions that could possibly  depend on a category-based inference.</li>
<li>You let an argument to slide into being about definitions, even though it isn’t what you originally wanted to argue about. </li>
<li>You think a word has a meaning, as a property of the word itself; rather than there being a label that your brain associates to a particualr concept.</li>

<li>You try to sneak in the connotations of a word, by arguing from a definition that doesn’t include the connotations.</li>

<li>You try to establish membership in an empirical cluster “by definition”.</li>
<li>Your definition draws a boundary around things that don’r realy belong together.</li>
<li>You use a short word for something that you won’t need to describe often. This can result in inefficient thinking, or even misapplications of Occam’s Razor, if your mind thinks that short sentences sound “simpler”.</li>
<li>You draw your boundary around a volume of space where there is no greater-than-usual density, meaning that the associated word does not correspond to any performable Bayesian inferences.</li>
<li>You draw an unsimple boundary without any reason to do so.</li>
<li>You use categorization to make inferences about properties that don’t have the appopriate empirical structure, namely, conditional independence given knowledge of the class, to be well-appoximated by Naive Bayes.</li>
<li>You think that words are like tiny little LISP symbols in your mind, rather than words being labels that act as handles to direct complex mental paintbrushes that can paint detailed pictures in your sensory workspace.</li>
<li>You use a word that has different meanings in different places as though it meant the same thing on each occasion, possibly creating the illusion of something protean and shifting.</li>
<li>You think that definitions can’t be wrong, or that “I can define a word any way I like!”</li>

<h2 id="Book-4-Mere-Reality"><a href="#Book-4-Mere-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Book 4: Mere Reality"></a>Book 4: Mere Reality</h2><p>natural world on its own right</p>
<h4 id="Soul"><a href="#Soul" class="headerlink" title="Soul"></a>Soul</h4><p>Giulio Giorello: “Yes, we have a soul, but it’s made of lots of tin robots.” (Humans are built out of inhuman parts. The world of atoms looks nothing like the world as we ordinarily think of it.)</p>
<h4 id="On-really-dissolving-questions"><a href="#On-really-dissolving-questions" class="headerlink" title="On really dissolving questions"></a>On really dissolving questions</h4><p>If there is any lingering feeling of a remaining unanswered question, or of having been fast0talked into something, then this is a sign that you have not dissolved the question. <strong>A vague dissatisfaction should be as much warning as a shout. Really dissolving the question doesn’t leave anything behind</strong></p>
<h4 id="Confusions-exists-in-the-map-not-the-territory"><a href="#Confusions-exists-in-the-map-not-the-territory" class="headerlink" title="Confusions exists in the map, not the territory"></a>Confusions exists in the map, not the territory</h4><p><strong>Unanswerable questions</strong> do not mark places where magic enters the universe. They mark places where your mind runs skew of reality.</p>
<h4 id="Probability-is-in-the-mind"><a href="#Probability-is-in-the-mind" class="headerlink" title="Probability is in the mind"></a>Probability is in the mind</h4><p>Jaynes was of the opinion that <strong>probabilites were in the mind, not in the environment</strong> - that probabilities express ignorance, states of partial information; and if I am ignorant of a phenomenon, that is a fact about my state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Probabilities express uncertainty, and it is only agents who can be uncertain. A blank map does not correspond to a blank territory. Ignorance is in the mind.</p>
<h4 id="Being-true-and-reliable"><a href="#Being-true-and-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Being true and reliable"></a>Being true and reliable</h4><p><strong>Truth</strong> involves comparing an internal belief to an external fact. Saying <strong>true</strong> compares a belief to reality.</p>
<p>“Show your arguments are globally reliable by virtue of each step being locally reliable; don’t just compare the argument’s conclusions to your intuitions.”</p>
<h4 id="Think-like-reality"><a href="#Think-like-reality" class="headerlink" title="Think like reality"></a>Think like reality</h4><p>Calling reality weird keeps you inside a viewpoint already proven erroneous. Probablity theory tells us that surprise is the measure of a poor hypothesis; if a model is consistently stupid - consistently hits on events the model assigns tiny probabilities - then it’s time to discard thet model. A good model makes reality look normal, not weird; a good model assigns high probability to that which is actually the case.<br>Intuition is only a model by another name: poor intuitions are shocked by reality; good intuitions make reality feel natural.</p>
<h4 id="Reductionism"><a href="#Reductionism" class="headerlink" title="Reductionism"></a>Reductionism</h4><p>Think laws not tools. Needing to calculate approximations to a law doesn’t change the law. Planes are still atoms, they aren’t governed by special exeptions in Nature for aerodynamic calculations. The approximation exists in the map, not in the terriotry.</p>
<p><em>Reductionism is not a positive belief, but rather, a disbelief that the higher levels of simplified multilevel models are out there in the territory.</em></p>
<p>The reductionist thesis (as I formulate it) is that <strong>human minds, for reasons of efficiency, use a mulit-level map in which we separately think about things like atoms and quarks, hands and fingers, or heat and kinetic energy. Reality itself, on the other hand, is sigle-level in the sense that it does not seem to contain atoms as separate, additional, causally efficacious entities over and above quarks.</strong></p>

<h4 id="Physicists-vs-rationalists"><a href="#Physicists-vs-rationalists" class="headerlink" title="Physicists vs rationalists"></a>Physicists vs rationalists</h4><p><strong>When physicists grow up</strong>, they learn to pla a new game called <em>Follow the negentropy</em> - which is really the same game they were playing all along; ony the rules are mathier, the game is more useful, and the principles are harder to wrap your mind around conceptually. (negentropy - energy is conserved and only canges its form)</p>
<p><strong>When rationalists grow up</strong>, they learn the game called <em>Follow the improbability</em>,  the grownup version of “How do you know?” The rule of the rationalist’s game is that every improbable-seeming belief neds an equivalent amount of evidence to justify it.</p>
<p>Both games have amazingly similar rules.</p>
<h4 id="Quantum-explanations"><a href="#Quantum-explanations" class="headerlink" title="Quantum explanations"></a>Quantum explanations</h4><p>“Confusion exists in our models of world not in the world itself.”</p>
<p><strong>A configuration says “a photon here, a photon there,” not “this photon here that photon there.”</strong> You can’t factorize the physics of our universe to be about particles with individual identities.<br>Part of the reason why humans have trouble coming to grips with the perfectly normal quantum physics, is that humans bizarrely keep trying to factor reality into a sum of individual real billiard balls.</p>
<h4 id="Falsifiable-and-testable-decoherence"><a href="#Falsifiable-and-testable-decoherence" class="headerlink" title="Falsifiable and testable (decoherence)"></a>Falsifiable and testable (decoherence)</h4><p><em>Falsifiability</em> is something you evaluate by looking at a single hypothesis, asking, “How narrowly does it concentrate its probability distribution over possible outcomes? How narrowly does it tell me what to expect? Can it explain some possible outcomes much better than others?”</p>
<p>It is usually not possible to apply formal probability theory in real life, any more than you can predict the winner of a tenns match using quantum field theory. But probability theory can serve as a guide to practice, this is what it says: <strong>Reject useless complications in general, not just when they are new.</strong></p>
<h3 id="Occam’s-Razor-1"><a href="#Occam’s-Razor-1" class="headerlink" title="Occam’s Razor"></a>Occam’s Razor</h3><p>“more complicated propositions require more evidence to believe, more complicated propositions also ought to require more work to raise to attention.”</p>
<h4 id="About-quantum-stuff-Quantum-non-realism"><a href="#About-quantum-stuff-Quantum-non-realism" class="headerlink" title="About quantum stuff - Quantum non-realism"></a>About quantum stuff - Quantum non-realism</h4><p>Egan’s Law: It all adds up to normality.<br>Apples didn’t stop falling when Einstein disproved Newton’s theory of gravity.</p>
<p>“How very hard it is to stay in a <strong>state of confessed confusion</strong>, without making up a story that gives you closure - how hard it is to avoid manipulating your ignorance as if it were definite knowledge that you possessed.”</p>
<h4 id="How-science-is-supposed-to-work"><a href="#How-science-is-supposed-to-work" class="headerlink" title="How science is supposed to work"></a>How science is supposed to work</h4><p>The ideal of how thing are <em>supposed</em> to work in science; to which all good scientists aspire. (not how it works in science in overall.)<br>The tradition handed down through the generations says that a new physics theory comes up with new experimental predicitions that distinguish it from the old theory. You perform the test, and the new theory is confirmed or falsified. If it’s confirmed, you hold a huge celebration, call the newspapers, and had out Nobel Pirizes for everyone; any doddering old emeritus professors who refuse to convert are quietly humored. If the theory is disconfirmed, the lead proponent publicly recants, and gains a reputation for honesty.</p>
<h4 id="Science-does-not-trust-your-rationality"><a href="#Science-does-not-trust-your-rationality" class="headerlink" title="Science does not trust your rationality"></a>Science does not trust your rationality</h4><p>“The final upshot is that Science is not easily reconciled with probability theory If you do a probability-theoretic calculation correclty, you’re going to get the <em>rational</em> answer.” <strong>Science doesn’t trust your rationality</strong>, and it doesn’t rely on your ability to use probbility theory as the arbiter of truth. <strong>It wants you to set up a definitive experiment</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="About-the-speed-of-science"><a href="#About-the-speed-of-science" class="headerlink" title="About the speed of science:"></a>About the speed of science:</h4><p>The method of science is to amass such an enormous mountain of evidence that even scientists cannot ignore it.<br>“A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.” &#x2F;Max Planck</p>

To dream of anything less than what you conceive to be perfection is to draw on less than the full power of the part of yoursself that dreams.</p>
<h4 id="Interlude-A-technical-explanation-of-technical-explanation"><a href="#Interlude-A-technical-explanation-of-technical-explanation" class="headerlink" title="Interlude - A technical explanation of technical explanation"></a>Interlude - A technical explanation of technical explanation</h4><p>“Īf you are ignorant, confess your ignorance; if you are confident, confess your confidence. We penalize you for being confident and wrong, but we also reward you for being confident and right.” That’s the virtue of a proper scoring rule.</p>
<p>“The way human pscychology seems to work is that first we see something happen, and then we try to argue that it matches whatever hypothesis we had in mind beforehand. <strong>Rather than conserved probability mass, to distribute over advance predictions, we have <em>a feeling of compatibility</em> - the degree to which the explanation and the event seem to fit.</strong>“</p>
<p>This is a technical explanation because “it enables you to calculate <em>exactly how technical an explanation is</em>.”</p>
<p>A hypothesis is something that controls your anticipations, the probabilities you assign to fitire experiences.</p>
<p>If a chain of reasoning doesn’t make me nervous, in advance, about waking up with a tentacle, then that reasoning would be a poor explanation if the event did happen.</p>
<p><em>Since the beginning<br>Not one unusual thing<br>Has ever happened.</em></p>

<h4 id="Recursive-justification"><a href="#Recursive-justification" class="headerlink" title="Recursive justification"></a>Recursive justification</h4><p>(“why do you think sun will rise today?” -“Because ir rose yesterday and all the days before.”)<br>“When you ask strange beings (with until now false priors) why they kwwp using priors that never seem to work in real life… they reply, “Because it’s never worked for us before!”<br>Lesson you might derive from this is <strong>“Don’t be born with a stupid prior!”</strong>“</p>
<p>The technique of rejecting beliefs that have no justification is in general an extremely importatn one. The fundamental question of rationality is “<strong>Why do you believe what you believe?</strong>“ I don’t even want to say something that <em>sounds</em> like it might allow a single exception to the rule that everything neeeds justification.</p>
<p>Rationalists want to get as close to the truth as we can possibly manage. So, at the end of the day, I embrace the principle: “<strong>Question your brain, question your intuitions, question your principles of rationality, using the full current force of your mind, and doing the best you can do at every point.</strong>“</p>
<h4 id="Metaethics"><a href="#Metaethics" class="headerlink" title="Metaethics:"></a>Metaethics:</h4><p>“Killing people is wrong” - that’s morality;<br>“Killing people is wrong because God prohibited it” - that’s metaethics.<br>And if your metaethics goes wrong, you should keep a line of retreat (so from “God prohibited killing” you don’t end up on “so killing is ok”).<br>The most important line of retreat is: If our metaethic stops telling you to save lives, you can just drag the kid off the train tracks anyway.</p>
