## Insights Discovery

[Insights](https://www.insights.com/) is a personality profiling tool, that categorizes people after filling a personality test and provides info about your strenghts, weaknesses and actionables on how to interact with the person and how the person should interact with others.

It uses color to communicate the different personality types. For example, each color coded personality type acts differently on their good days:

and bad days:

## My Insights profile

[My full Insights profile](/docs/reforming-observer-classic.pdf)

I filled the test in October 2022 and got the result of Reforming Observer (blue + red).

It did nailed some of my traits, but I felt it made me look too serious and shy than I really am.

### Strategies for communicating with Rota:

- **Be honest, ~~moderately paced,~~ straightforward and open with her.**
- Give her all the facts.
- Expect her to be concerned and critical at times.
- ~~Maintain a serious disposition.~~
- Approach her in a structured, logical way.
- Provide information step by step.
- Find out where you can get the extra information she may require.
- **Organise your thoughts before communicating.**
- Encourage her to consider flexibility and change.
- **Ensure that she understands the rules.**
- Respect her personal experience.
- Use humour ~~in moderation.~~


### Key Strengths

- Accuracy.
- ~~Quiet~~ and conscientious.
- ~~Good at undertaking routine tasks.~~
- Fair mindedness in implementing systems.
- She is well informed, especially on more technical information.
- In touch with herself and her world.
- Usually weighs up all relevant factors before reaching decisions.
- **Honours her commitments.**
- Will work late to get the job done.
- ~~Does not accept second best.~~

### Key Weaknesses

- Tends to undervalue the differences in people.
- Tendency not to act until all the facts are available.
- Avoids company of those unlike her.
- Sensitive to criticism of her work.
- **May be slow or unwilling to express her true feelings.**
- Tends to clam up if not encouraged to express herself.
- May be perceived as being terminally serious.
- May suppress creativity.
- Sometimes unwilling to express even important ideas or insights.
- **May hurt others with criticism.**

### Color Dynamics

My color dynamics show that I use traits I feel confident in and don't bother much trying to be someone else. (Even so, I secretly thought I would have a completely wild less conscious persona)

> About ~80% of the description below feels true.

A capacity for cool emotional detachment makes Rota a good decision maker, because she thinks clearly under pressure. She may need assistance in tapping into her creativity and to bring projects to completion. Although objective, she may be more interested in finding creative solutions to problems than in seeing those solutions become reality. Material wealth may interest her only for the independence it buys and for the additional opportunity it provides for her own private study. She has a creative mind which can be used to bring forward thinking and originality to processes and projects.

Although ~~quiet~~ and reserved, she can articulate well on a subject to which she is devoted. Her desire for privacy sometimes generates a vague feeling in others that there is an unlived life that may be passing her by. **Rota gains great pleasure from improving upon existing techniques with the objective of maximising efficiency and cost effectiveness**. Her need to detach herself from her emotions allows her to retain objectivity when assisting others in times of stress. She may impress others, albeit unintentionally, by knowing something worthwhile about many things, especially when she speaks about one of her specialised subjects.

Because she relies heavily on logical analysis, she can overlook what matters to others. She uses her thinking to run as much of the world as she can and is in her element when a situation needs to be organised, criticised or regulated. Practical, systematic, thorough and hard working, **Rota likes everything to be stated clearly and simply**. In her own field she has a leaning towards the technical, but may tend to underestimate her own abilities. She is usually ~~neat,~~ tidy and orderly, both at work and at home. She is seen by others as intellectually independent.

Rota is analytical, impersonal and interested in underlying principles. As **she likes conversation to be purposeful**, and ~~may argue practicalities to the point of hair-splitting~~, she tends to be convinced only by reason. ~~Rota's nature is to observe quietly~~ and she appears to be collecting data on everything. However, when an emergency occurs, she can move swiftly to the root of the problem to deal with it expeditiously. Rota has a gift for seeing the important facts of a situation. She is persevering, with a singleness of purpose that she devotes to long term achievement of the mind. ~~She is an ideal academic who continually seeks knowledge for its own sake.~~

~~Unless someone else can put her ideas into practice, they may be lost.~~ She is aesthetically appreciative and values quality. ~~She often sees when colours match or blend and~~ may have a highly developed taste for art, music and food. Her interest lies in seeing possibilities beyond what is already present and known, by using her insight, ingenuity and intellect. When she does need company it may be difficult for her to reach out to people and to overcompensate for this she may retreat even further into herself. She is a good listener, with an ability to talk well when appropriate.
