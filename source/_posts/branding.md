## Market analysis

1. Find target audience with a buyer persona based on available info you have from:
    a. demographics from analytics
    b. pain points from competitor's reviews => that leads to goal => that leads to how we can help
2. Find marketing channels
    a. Find your biggest niched competitors (~10 is best) - as close as you as possible preferably who are bigger than you => google you offer!
    b. Find competitor's marketing channels - similarweb.com
        - if 25%+ comes from paid traffic, their used channel is google ads;
        - if any social media traffic is 25%+, that is also a channel they use;
    c. Select you marketing channels - summarize the popularity of the channels competitors used and take those which are over 5


## SEO

keyword can have two intentions:
- curiosity intent => content page
- buy intent => product page

### keyword analysis
> the longer the kyword, the easier it is generally to rank for it => longer tail keywords
#### Tools
use **GA Keyword Planner** to get similar options for keywords
**MozBar** Chrome extension for getting an idea of how honed the search results are:
we are looking for links that have PA or DA (page and domain authorities) to be below 25. That means it is an underused keyword and we can also get to that place in results.

Your task is to gather potential keywords that you can optimize for

##### Generic keyword search
search your product in GA keyword planner and pick the most promising ones
turn on the extension and check in relatively high enough are low authority links
if yes - take a note of those keywords and their volume!

##### Search from our competitors
other way around: google search who is the best link in a generic keyword of your industry and check that page in Keyword planner

### content creation
type in a search box the worthy keywords you found and pick the best suggestions from them. That's your content title!

Tips:
- Only one sentence per paragraph
- add images as much as possible
- use headers
- always have a goal with your content
- 500 or above words is best

use internal links and lat text!

#### URLS
like post names
not too long
don't repeat keywords


### Speed

Google SEO ranking likes sites that:
- fully load under 3s
- are less than 1MB
- images should not be more than 100-150KB each. if they are - [optimize](imagecompressor.com) them!

An analytics tool https://gtmetrix.com/ is useful for finding these things out.

## Email marketing

Every email should consist of:
1. a hook: short bold statement that connects your audience on a personal and emotional level
2. a story: biggest part, connects with your audience on a deeper level - you know where they are
3. an offer: something actionable. Short for free and small, long for expensive and time-consuming.

Types of emails:
- products/services pitch email
- product launch email
- testimonial/review request email
- discount offer email
- re-engagement email
- newsletter email: expectation
- latest blog post email

> scarcity is a great sales technique

It is a good idea to trim your email list and remove those who are inactive to save your space.

Benchmark for email marketing - 20% open rate and 1-2% cilck rate

> Like with all email marketing, it's like throwing spaghetti on a wall and looking what sticks.

### Testimonial and review

You are not offering anything, but asking for a favor, so you are leaning towards your customer kindness.

#### Example

Subject: Could you do us a small favor?
Text: Hi [Name]
In our opinion, you’re a 5-star customer! We truly hope that you
feel the same about [name of the product].
If you enjoyed it, would you like to help us and others who would
like to buy it too, by writing a quick review?
[insert link]
We know your time is valuable and that we’re asking for a lot.
You’d be doing us a huge favor!
We really appreciate your help!
Thank you so much,
[Your signature]

## Branding

Branding comes first:
> You can't market a brand you haven't designed yet.

Branding is the "What" you are going to deliver to your customer:
- what feelings people have for you
- what you are
- what makes you unique
- what people are saying about you
- what you want to achieve
- what you value
- what you are saying
- what you look like

> brand is your personality

![branding](/images/branding.png)

Marketing is "How" you will deliver:
- how you are communicating
- how you are delivering
- how you are unique
- how you will make money
- how you grow your business
- how you are writing (messages)

> how you show your personality

![marketing](/images/marketing.png)

### Brand lasts and marketing changes

Brand design
Brand message
Brand personality
Brand positioning
Internal communication

![marketing history](/images/marketing_history.png)


Branding is what keeps the customer
Marketing is how to get a customer
Together it's a success.

Where are you competitors failing customers? Find out and fill that void.


![branding iceberg](/images/branding_iceberg.png)


### Purpose

**Why** are you doing what you are doing? (outside the money)

- what is your belief of positive change
- what adds value outside your customers
- how do you build emotional connections
- what differentiates you from competitors
- your purpose needs to reflect what you are selling


1. why do you do what you do?
2. who do you want to help?
3. What can you help with?
4. Would your audience like (your purpose)?
5. What does your audience like?

### Vision

Vision is somewhere between a dream and a goal, like a moonshot.

Your vision should be big that is a little bit scary to say out loud.

- where do you dream to be?
- what do you dream to achieve?
- when are you achieving that?
- does it feel big and scary but good?

### Mission

Brand mission is steps towards future vision.

> A goal without a plan is just a dream.

- what are you dedicated to achieve?
- what can you do every day/week/month/year?

### Values

what you believe in, talk about and are passionate about
they will guide your brands action and create brand identity

![types of values](/images/types_of_values.png)

- what do you believe in?
- what are you passionate about?
- what are the topics you do you talk about (with friends)?

### Competitors

direct competitors - same service and same market
indirect competitors - same market, but a different service/product

collect around 10 competitors
`[location] [your service/product] (in)direct competitors`

look for honest reviews:
- what is common amongst your competitors (what is common)
- what good are people saying? how does that make them feel?
- what are the most common bad reviews? how does that make them feel?
- is there anything you can do better?
- is there something you can specialize in?

### Differentiatior

**look for gaps to fill**

- who are your competitors?
- how are they naming themselves?
- what products/services re they selling?
- what markets and categories are they in?
- how and where do they market themselves?
- who are their target audience?
- how do they price themselves?

Examples:
- price
- quality
- service level
- delivery
- design
- marketing
- types of customers

### Positioning

people want to belong
people want experiences and emotion

Positioning statement ingredients:
- target customers
- benefits your product/service offers
- your competitors
- your differentiator

and formula:
`To [your target audience], [your brand] is [your differentiating benefit your my customer] by [how you are making it possible].`

### Personality

identity made of characteristics, thoughts, behaviours and emotions.

Personality is humanizing the brand so it can make it easy for customers to connect and relate to. Just as real human beings, you can't serve everyone.

But keep it consistent:
- brand message
- social media connection
- product descriptions
- customer conversations
- influencers you are working with
- storytelling
- colors

> Clients may come to you because of **what you do**, but they stay with you of **who you are**.

To define, look at:
- how do you present yourself?
- how do you dress?
- how do you behave around people?

![personality types](/images/personality_types.png)

### Voice

Brand voice is the way you are saying what you are saying to connect to your audience.

How does your brand talk to people? (how you greet?)
How does your customers talk to people? (how do they greet?)
What adjectives you use to describe your brand?

![brand voice](/images/voice.png)

### Brand story

Storytelling is about getting and keeping **attention** by creating a story that people can relate to. When we have people's attention, we can start selling our products and services.

It is about your customer not about your brand.


1. The Hero (your target customer)
2. Their problem (what's in the way?)
3. CTA (what sparks their action?)
4. Meets their guide (your brand)
5. Their challenge (their competition)
6. The change (the desired result)
7. New life (your customers desired life)

### Name of your brand

your aim is to be creative with words

good way to start is making a mindmap from collecting words from `[product] synonym`

go with brand names that are:
- future proof
- easily rememberable (short and sweet)

### Tagline

tagline - sticks to your brand
slogan - changes by campaign

to create one:
- start by writing what you do and stand for
