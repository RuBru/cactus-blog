*Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived*

## Summary

Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis is a book for people in their mid-20's, who are stuck in their life, because they do not know what to want or how to move towards what they want in life.

It says that we are the **first generation who has the time to actually think through what we want in our lives before we get into the circle of baby booming**. Nowadays we think first and do after.

The book consists of specific questions grouped by themes:
- Hopes and Dreams
- Relationships
- Work Life
- Home, Friends and Family
- Identity

> Having Quarterlife Crisis issues doesn’t mean you’re weird, flawed, or spoiled.

Or in other words - I am not the only one in the world who feels very stuck, there are many, many more like me. It is like a secret depressed people club, that somehow gives you the comfort of knowing there are others.

Why it gives me comfort? Because unfortunately, I feel very alone in my life and social circle (at least in this matter) and have nobody with whom to share this.

### Moto to take from the book

> Be the best self you can be.

## Quotes

> The only way to feel ‘unstuck’ is to stop trying to figure everything out at once and concentrate on making a first step, as scary as it might be.

> Accept what you can and cannot control.

> If you don’t like yourself or aren’t happy, my advice is to simplify your life so that the only things that take up your time are things that can put you on a path to being happy again. Then, once you’re at peace with yourself, you can build up a new life from there.

> Write down ten things that light up your life. Do at least one of them every day.

> Stop beating yourself to a mental pulp if the life you have isn’t the one you want, and instead relax, listen to your little black box, and enjoy the process of finding new goals and pursuing them.

## Conclusions

Basically, this book did a very good job of what I have been looking for - mentoring and sharing experiences of successes (and just some average experiences, too). It gives condensed, easily understandabe and useful advices oof how to actually tackle the complex questions on Quarterlife crisis. I should at least look into those questions later on.
