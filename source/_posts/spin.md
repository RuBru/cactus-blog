SPIN Selling book is a classic salesman book. I read it mostly to be more familiar with the most common selling techniques used on me.

I thought it will be more harsh and pushy, but I was suprised in a good way that the selling technique was very civil and more about providing a common good and not using any dark patterns.

## 4 golden rules for learning
1. Practice only one behaviour at a time
2. Try the New behaviour at least 3 times
3. Quantity before Quality
4. Practice in safe situations

## The selling call stages:
1. Preliminaries (warm-up)
2. Investigating (finding out facts, information and needs)

### Here comes the SPIN sequence:
- Situation questions (about facts, background, what he is doing now, too many can bore/irritate customer)
- Problem questions (about customer's problems, difficulties, dissatisfactions. Linked with success in smaller sales, less powerful in major sales)
- Implication questions (About consequences or effects of a customer's problems. Increases customer's perception of value in the solution, crucial in major sales)
- Need-payoff questions (About the value, usefulness, utility that the customer perceives in a solution. Linked to success in the major sales)

### Demonstrating capability

Show that you've got something wothwhile to offer
- Make Benefits (not Features or Advantages), show how your product/service meets Explicit Needs which have been expressed.

### Obtaining Commitment

Gain an agreement to proceed to a further stage of the sale
- Check that you've covered key concerns
- Summarize the Benefits
- Propose an appropriate level of commitment
