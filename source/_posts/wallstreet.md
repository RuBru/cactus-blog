Random walk down the Wall Street is a personal finance classic. This is a fundamental book as it has been written ~40 years ago and still is relevant.

The book consists of four big parts:
1. **Stocks and their value**: a short intro in the history of financial markets and its bubbles.
2. **How the pros play the biggest game in town**: how good or bad the various analysis used to pick stocks work (= bad!).
3. **The new investment technology**: more elaborate investment techniques created in the last decades.
4. **A practical guide for random walkers and other investors**: guides, techniques and specific advice to create personalised investment portfolio.

I enjoyed the book, especially the 1st and 4th part. I don't remember the last part of 3rd section as that got quite complex. Sadly this, as most books about personal finance, is a book for US audience. That means that most advice about taxes and law is not apliccable to me as I am European.
