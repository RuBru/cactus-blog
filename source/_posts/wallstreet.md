Random walk down the Wall Street is a personal finance classic. This is a fundamental book as it has been written ~40 years ago and still is relevant.

The book consists of four big parts:
1. **Stocks and their value**: a short intro in the history of financial markets and its bubbles.
2. **How the pros play the biggest game in town**: how good or bad the various analysis used to pick stocks work (= bad!).
3. **The new investment technology**: more elaborate investment techniques created in the last decades.
4. **A practical guide for random walkers and other investors**: guides, techniques and specific advice to create personalised investment portfolio.

I enjoyed the book, especially the 1st and 4th part. I don't remember the last part of 3rd section as that got quite complex. Sadly this, as most books about personal finance, is a book for US audience. That means that most advice about taxes and law is not apliccable to me as a European.

# Stocks and their value

What is value and how you determine it? That's the question we learn about in this section and go through main stock pricing theories and the history of stock market's heights and lows.

## Firm foundation theory

The firm foundation theory argues that each investment instrument, be it a common stock or a piece of real estate, has a firm anchor of something called intrinsic value, which can be determined by careful analysis of present conditions and future prospects.

Firm-foundation theory relies on some tricky forecasts of the extent and duration of future growth. The foundation of intrinsic value may thus be less dependable than is claimed.

## Castle-in-the-air theory

The castle-in-the-air theory of investing concentrates on psychic values. It was a famous investors opinion that professional investors prefer to devot their energies not to estimating intrinsic values, but rather to analyzing how the crowd of investors is likely to behave in the future and how during periods of optimism they tend to build their hopes into castles in the air. The successful investor tries to beat the gun by estimating what investment situations are most susceptible to public castle-building and then buying before the crowd.

> no one knows for sure what will influence future earnings' prospects and dividend payments. ... Most people are largely concerned not with making superior long-term forecasts for an investment over its whole life, but with foreseeing changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the general public.
/ John Maynard Keynes, got popular in 1936

> October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in.The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.
/ Mark Twain, Pudd'nhead Wilson

## Madness of crowds

Since there has been a market, there have been speculative bubbles and crisis after those:
- The tulip bulb craze
- The south sea bubble
- Wall street lays an egg (1929)

In the past century since the sixties the craze has gone from private to institutional investing:
- 60's: The growth-stock/new-issue craze (space age: if anything has a name ..tronics or something you don't understand, you buy it)
- 60's: The conglomerate boom (join two companies and suddenly they are growing)
- 60's: The bubble in Concept stocks (buy "performance")
- 70's: The nifty fifty stocks (a bunch of big growth company stocks, just "one decision" to make)
- 80's: The return of New Issues (microelectronics and biotechnology age: if anything has a name ..bot, you buy it)
- 90's:Japanese yen for land and stocks (because Japan's land and stocks in 100x more worthy than 40 years ago)

> The consistent losers in the market, from my perosnal experience, are those who are unable to resist being swept up in some kind of tuli-bulb craze. It is not hard to make money in the market. What is hard to avoid is the alluring temptation to throw your money away on short, get-rich-quick speculative binges.

And of course, this millenia is even better than the previous:
- 2000: dot-com bubble
- 2008: housing bubble
- 2017: crypto bubble

> Bubbles are "positive feedback loops". A bubble starts when any groups of stocks, in this case those associated with the excitement of the internet, begin to rise. The updraft encourages more people to buy the stocks, which causes more TV and print coverage, which causes even more people to buy, which creates big profits for early internet stockholders. The successful investors tell you how easy it is to get rich, which causes the stocks to rise further, whic pulls in larger and larger groups of investors. But the whole mechanism is a kind of Ponzi scheme where more and more credulous investors must be found to buy the stock from the earlier investors. Eventually, one runs out of **greater fools**.


> The market eventually corrects any irrationality - albeit in its own slow, inexorable fashion. Anomalies can crop up, markets can get irrationally optimistic, and often they attract unwary investors. But, **eventually, true value is recognized by the market**, and this is the main lesson investors must heed.
>
> I am also persuaded by the wisdom of Benjamin Graham, author of Security Analysis, who wrote that in the final analysis the stock market is not a voting mechanism but a weighing mechanism. Valuation metrics have not changed. Eventually, every stock can only be worth the present value of its cash flow. In the final analysis true value will win out.

# How the pros play the biggest game in town

> As more and more people use the technique, the value deteriorates.

The alternative techniques used by the investment pros are related to the two theories of the stick market:
- **Technical analysis** is the method of predicting the approriate time to buy or sell a stock used by those believing in the **castle-in-the-air** view of stock pricing.
- **Fundamental analysis** is the technique of applying the tenets of the **firm-foundation** theory to the seecltion of individual stocks.

## Technical vs fundamental analysis

Technical analysis is essentially the making and interpreting of stock charts. Many chartists believe the stock market is only 10% logical and 90% psychological.S

Fundamental analysis believe that the market is 90% logical and only 10% psychological. Fundamentalists seek to determine a stock's proper value.

> Any regularity in the stock market that can be discovered and acted upon profitably is bound to destroy itself. This is the fundamental reason why I am convinced that no one will be successful in using technical methods to get above-average returns in the stock market.

### The rule of 72

The rule of 72 provides a shortcut way to determine how long it takes for money to double. Take the interest rate you earn and divide it into the number 72, and you get the number of years it will take to double your money.

For example, if the interest rate is 15 percent, it takes 72/15=4.8 years to double.

## Efficient market hypothesis

There is a major battle between market professionals and academics. Efficient market hypothesis holds that the stock market is so good at adjusting to new information that no one can predict its future course in a superior manner. Prices of individual stocks quickly reflect all the news that is available.

> Your guess is as good as that of the ape, your stockbroker, or even mine.

In the last decades, academics have set their eyes to stock market and test the promise of enormous profit. They have concluded that
> security analysts have enormous difficulty in performing their basic function of forecasting company earnings prospects. Investors who put blind faith in such forecasts in making their investment selections are in for some rude disappiontments.


In long term, no fund or professional has ever beaten the market. If they have, it is in line with rules of chance. What is crazy, market professionals are worse than chance. You might be better off by picking random stocks than by trusting a professional.

# The new investment technologies

## Modern portfolio theory

Long-term studies show that on average, investors have received higher rates of return for bearing greater risk.

Portfolios of risky (volatile) stocks might be put together in such a way that the portfolio as a whole could be less risky than the individual stocks in it = DIVERSIFICATION!

> The golden number = at least 50 equal-sized and well-diversified US stocks.
> With such a portfolio, the total risk is reduced by over 60%. Further increases in number of holdings do not produce much additional rosk reduction.

## Capital-asset pricing model

The basic logic behind the capital-asset pricing model is that there is no premium for bearing risks that can be diversified away. Thus, to get a higher average long-run rate of return, you need to increase the risk level of the portfolio that cannot be diversified away. According to this theory, savvy investors can outperform the overall market by adjusting their portfolios with a risk measure known as **beta** (systematic or market risk).

> the capital-asset pricing model says that returns (and, therefore, risk premiums) for any stock (or portfolio) will be related to beta, the systematic risk that cannot be diversified away.

### Fama-French risk factor

To add another layer, French and Fama have propsed a factor model to account for risk based on their empirical work.

- Beta: from the Captial-Asset pricing model (CAPM)
- Size: measured by total equity market capitalization
- Value: measured by the ratio of market to book value
