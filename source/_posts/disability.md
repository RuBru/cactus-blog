Sightsavers recognizes that there are 4 mindsets/models how you can approach disability:
1. Medical
2. Charity/welfare
3. Social
4. Human rights

## Medical model

Focus on 'fixing' or 'curing' individual impairments

> Disability is **within the individual**

Example: A child is born deaf and is given a cochlear implant at the age of two.

## Charity/welfare model

Focus on perceived individual limitations

> People with disabilities seen as **victims needing care and protection**

Example: a child is born deaf and people assume they will never be able to attend school like 'normal' children.

## Social model

Focus on **removing barriers in society**

> It is society which disables physically impaired people. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments.
/Vic Finkenstein

> Disability movement: **Nothing about us without us**

Example: a qualified Deaf woman doesn't get a job because employers are not willing to provide reasonable accomodations (like sign language interpretation)

## Human rights model

Focus on **inalienable human rights**

> Disability is seen as a **natural and common aspect of the human experience**

> People with disabilities are seen as **rights-holders**

Example: a child is born deaf, and their right to health care, social inclusion and education must be guaranteed.

## Conclusions

These models are not exclusive - you can operate on many levels at the same time. Sightsavers does this: adds are targeted from the level 2, internally operate on level 3 and level 4.

Historically, we are moving 'up' - just about 10 years ago mainstream was level medical and chairity models, now the shift is happening towards mainstreaming social and human rights models as also UN has [ratified the rights of people with disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) a long time ago.
