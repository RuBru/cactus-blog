## The Metronome Training Method

### 1. Read normally
Read normally for five minutes from a book which you will be able to continue using. Record your words per minute on a Progress Graph.
### 2. Train with a light book
Use any book (light material) of your choice, preferably one in which you are interested.
Aim for as much comprehension as possible, but remember that this exercise is primarily concerned with speed. In this exercise, you should continue reading from the last point you reached.
1. Practice-read for one minute at 100 wpm faster than your highest normal speed
2. Practice-read 100 wpm faster than 1.
3. Practice-read 100 wpm faster than 2.
4. Practice-read 100 wpm faster than 3.
5. Practice-read 100 wpm faster than 4. using [High Speed Practice 1](#3-High-Speed-Practice-1)
6. Practice-read with comprehension for one minute from the point reached at the end of previous speed. Calculate and record your wpm on a Progress Graph.

### 3. High Speed Practice 1
1. Use any easy book. Start from the beginning of a chapter
2. Practice-read with visual aid, three lines at a time at a minimum of 2000 wpm for five mnutes. Mark the point where you stop.
