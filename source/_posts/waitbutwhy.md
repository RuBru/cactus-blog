## Self help for societies? Really?

Not as advertised. It's not a self help book, as 90% of it was spent on explaining his framework of societies and modern political views, particularly Social Justice Fundamentalism.

For calling it a self help book, it put itself to a set standard. In reality, the standart was not met as it talked just about the problems in society and provided almost no solutions.

It also focused mostly on one side of the spectrum (liberal) with giving them almost half of the pages while providing Republicans only one relatively short chapter. I really enjoyed that chapter and would have liked to learn more about the conservative side of society just to relate better.

## The good things

- definitions and terminology - now we have a wider vocabulary for societal topics.
- pretty [pictures and diagrams](/docs/Whats-Our-Problem-Audiobook-Visuals-Companion.pdf) - as usual by Tim and his blog
- it made much sense - I can't not see his points and framework IRL anymore

I do think this book has given me a better understanding about the (western, US) world and how politics is really complicated and a weird human construct.

## Social Justice Fundamentalism

The half a book about Social Justice Fundamentalism (SJF) really gave me an understanding of what is wrong with liberalism - how SJF has taken over it. I completely agree with Tim and the points he is making. Social Justice Fundamentalism is rotten and has a low rung quality - it is not scientific thinking, but stupid shouting and doing more harm than good.
