|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1. You encounter a choice   | narrow framing makes you miss options                              | Widen your options             |
| 2. You analyze your options | the confirmation bias leads you to gather self-serving information | Reality-test your assumptions  |
| 3. You make a choice        | short-term emotion will often tempt you to make the wrong one      | Attain distace before deciding |
| 4. Then you live with it    | you'll often be overconfident about how the future will unfold     | Prepare to be wrong            |

## Quotes

> If you want to think new thoughts that are different, then do what a lot of creative people do — get the problem reasonably clear and then refuse to look at any answers until you've thought the problem through carefully how you would do it, how you could slightly change the problem to be the correct one.

> ... in helping us to break a decision logjam, the single most effective question may be:
> What would I tell my best friend to do in this situation?
